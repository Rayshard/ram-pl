Compile DLLs with g++ -shared -o <out name>.dll <file name>.cpp 

DONE:
	- 
TO CHECK:
	- Make sure that unknown values must be cast/resolved before use, i.e, you can't assign a variable
	an unknown value or use them in expressions. They're basically like exceptions that can be cast to
	a valid type.
	- Allow function type definition to have a function sig as a return type
	- Check all binops are right
TO IMPLEMENT:
	- make id that is given by dllOpen and dllGet random numbers
	- string.substring
TODO:
	- only have return, break and continue in appropriate places
	- Handle Stack overflows
	- create right exceptions
	- operators
		- all boolean operators
		- pow operator
		- has definition operator

		Binary: =, ==, !=, ^, %, &, |, ||, &&, <<, >>, +=, -=, *=, /=, ^=, %=, &=, |=, .
	- dll stuff
	- When implementing char
		- change string index function to return char
	- add ability to declare func in typedef
	- add more primitive types: short, char, long
	- add 'num' primitive type
		- it represents any number (internally stored as a string)

Optimizations:
	- After Parsing is complete, change all binops that have their left and right
	has values already to that value

Ram Language Documentation:
	- Code files are marked with .ram
	- Include files are marked with .iram

	- Note that functions have access to all the symbols (including variables) in the scope in which they
	are defined. This includes symbols defined after the function definition but still in the same scope. It
	is good practice to use include bracke
