TO CHECK:
	- Check all binops are right
TODO:
	- IValue.GetCopy() should take in execPos so that new values have the right pos
	- only have return, break and continue in appropriate places
	- Handle Stack overflows
	- create right exceptions
	- operators
		- all boolean operators
		- pow operator
		- has definition operator

		Binary: =, ==, !=, ^, %, &, |, ||, &&, <<, >>, +=, -=, *=, /=, ^=, %=, &=, |=, .
	- add arrays and lists
	- dll stuff
	- add more primitive types: short, char, long
	- add 'num' primitive type
		- it represents any number (internally stored as a string)

Optimizations:
	- After Parsing is complete, change all binops that have their left and right
	has values already to that value

Ram Language Documentation:
	- Code files are marked with .ram
	- Include files are marked with .iram

	- Note that functions have access to all the symbols (including variables) in the scope in which they
	are defined. This includes symbols defined after the function definition but still in the same scope. It
	is good practice to use include bracke
